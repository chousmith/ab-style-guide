## Font(s)

[Lato Lato Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?selection.family=Lato)

Preferably in as few families as possible. Like really only just "400,400i,700"

## Misc

Also while there are quotation marks, should really &ldquo;`&ldquo;` and `&rdquo;`&rdquo;

And also &mdash; `&mdash;` &mdash; not quite sure when to mdash vs ndash&hellip;

Also numbers one through ten or twelve should be written out, but 30 is ok and &ldquo;1-10 or 30&rdquo; is ok too

## Headers and other elements

For starters at least, here is a general breakdown of Typography that we tried to clean up for "AbacusNext v1.5 (AN1.5)"...

# H1 Header 1 used very sparingly

## H2 Header 2 is ok

### H3 Header 3

#### H4 Header 4

##### H5 Header 5 even?

This is a blockquote: in markdown it just means starting with a &gt;
