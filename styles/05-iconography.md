description: How to style or construct icons for the design system

> Icons are a unique beast, so it's important to define how to use and create icons for the design system.

## Font Awesome

We are all about that [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons) version [4.6.3](https://www.abacusnext.com/sites/all/libraries/fontawesome/css/font-awesome.css)

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.3/css/font-awesome.min.css" />

Actually, not quite sure what that means. There could be icons, but for the most part not so much. Mainly just some arrows and carrots and things.

<i class="fa fa-chevron-down fa-2x"></i>

<a href="#" style="color: #e33e07"><i class="fa fa-arrow-right fa-2x"></i></a>

<a href="#" style="color: #e33e07; text-decoration: none;">Read more <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i></a>

## Other iconography

Other "icons" come from icon sets in images mostly. New style is like https://www.abacusnext.com/software/case-management/abacuslaw

1. 80x80 round circle with bg color Abacus Dark Blue `#212b3e`
2. White icon roughly sized to 64x64 centered in that space
3. Additional icon(s) or pieces highlighted in Abacus Red

<span class="fa-stack fa-lg fa-3x">
  <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x" style="color:#212b3e"></i>
  <i class="fa fa-cloud fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-stack-1x" style="color:#e33e07"></i>
</span>

Not too shabby
